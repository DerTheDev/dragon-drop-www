<h1 style="text-align: center;">Terms Of Service</h1>
<p>By using DragonDrop you abide by these terms of service. If you fail to meet these requirements your account on DragonDrop may be terminated without warn. We suggest you acknowledge&nbsp;and read through this.</p>
<p>DragonDrop is created by a group of developers and designers willing to share their creativity. In no means are you allowed to take credit for the whole of your website creation and the elements (such as pictures) provided. The graphics and images belong to their own respective owner and the same for the website's source code. If you would like to use the website's source code which is available you must give credit to our developers as they have spent a lot of time working on that. Most staff team members have admin access but you must never go around asking for things. You won't get what you want and you'll receive a warning.</p>
<p>If you so happen to break these rules you will get a warning. Acquire three and you will have to be blocked/banned. You can appeal from the ban but after acquiring three extra warnings after the unblock will result in a permanent ban from DragonDrop. When you are blocked you are also IP-banned so you are unable to register with other account to avoid it.</p>
<p>DragonDrop is a content management system where you can create whatever you can imagine using a module website creator. Since the creators of DragonDrop met on Scratch.mit.edu, DragonDrop has features especially for Scratchers. However DragonDrop is in no-way affiliated with Scratch or the MIT lab in Cambridge, USA.</p>
