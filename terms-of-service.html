<p>Our developers, designers and helpers have spent countless hours working extremely hard to get DragonDrop to its current state. To make sure that their hard work is used correctly and used how it should be, there are some terms that you must abide by. Failing to do so may result in your account being terminated. So we suggest reading this and acknoledging the following article.</p>
<p><strong>Availability</strong></p>
<p>i) Once published your website can be viewed and accessed by everyone who has access to the internet with a browser. You must make it appropriate for all ages, or you site and account will be taken down.</p>
<p>ii) Comments currently can not be deleted to discourage the use of swears etc. We deal with reports very carefully and anyone can report you at any time if you have done something wrong.</p>
<p>iii) Your account will also be public to the website, so please do not give any personal contacts on there as we do not take responsibility for spam you may recieve etc.</p>
<p><strong>Source Code</strong></p>
<p>i) We do like it when people make use of our source code, however you must credit the whole development team who had created DragonDrop if you are unsure of the certain developer that coded that section.</p>
<p>ii) We consider taking more than just a few lines of code is called stealing. In the unlikely case that this happens often, the source code will be private only to the development team.</p>
<p><strong>Features</strong></p>
<p>i) If someone has created a comment, profile or website with innapropriate content only then can the report button be used. Spamming it will result in an account termination or not being able to report. This goes the same for the support feature.</p>
<p><strong>Copyright</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;i) DragonDrop was created with features to make scratchers create their own personal websites for their Scratch accounts quicker. However, DragonDrop is not affiliated with Scratch or MIT.</p>
